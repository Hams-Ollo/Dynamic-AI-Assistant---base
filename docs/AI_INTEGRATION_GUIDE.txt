   - Review existing implementations of:
     * text_scraper.py
     * chat_agent.py
     * memory.py
     * Related utility modules
   - Document all external API dependencies and their versions

2. Architecture Assessment
   - Evaluate current data flow patterns
   - Identify integration points for new features
   - Map out existing class relationships
   - Note potential bottlenecks or scalability concerns

   - File system operations
   - Database operations
   - Network requests
   ```

3. Performance Considerations
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Use async operations for I/O-bound tasks
   - Batch process when possible
   - Monitor memory usage in vector operations

4. Security Best Practices
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Secure API key handling
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Validate URLs before scraping

## TESTING AND VALIDATION

1. Unit Tests
   ```
   Coverage Requirements:
   - Memory management functions
   - Scraping operations
   - Intent classification
   - Response generation
   ```

2. Integration Tests
   ```
   Test Scenarios:
   - End-to-end message processing
   - Feedback loop effectiveness
   - Knowledge base updates
   - Error recovery scenarios
   ```

3. Performance Metrics
   ```
   Key Metrics to Track:
   - Response time
   - Memory usage
   - Scraping success rate
   - Classification accuracy
   ```

## DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS

1. Environment Setup
   - Verify all dependencies are installed
